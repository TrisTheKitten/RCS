**Logitech LUA Recoil Control System**

This script works with all Logitech mice. It's a simple tool that helps control weapon recoil in games. Press the fifth mouse button to activate it and cycle through different recoil control settings using the fourth mouse button. The script will move your mouse in a specific pattern to counter recoil, customizable for your preferences.

To use it, install Logitech G Hub and create a new script in your desired profile. Copy and paste this script into the editor and save it.

This script is for educational purposes only. Using macros is against the terms of service of most games and can result in bans. Use at your own risk.

This script was developed by Tris The Kitten. You can request features or report bugs on the GitHub page: (https://github.com/TrisTheKitten/RCS). I'm continually updating it with new features and improvements. Thank you for using it!
